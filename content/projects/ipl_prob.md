    <!-- Have you ever checked the live score of any cricket match on google? I bet you have. And if you are a cricket fan, you would have noticed google offers a live _win probability_ prediction for any cricket match. My inner curative genius (and my 2rd yr Minor Project Deadline) motivated me to develop an end-to-end machine learning project using Python to predict the probability of an IPL cricket team winning a match given an instance of the match. -->
    - Utilized a comprehensive Machine Learning Development Life Cycle approach to ensure robustness and reliability of the model.
    - Used complex libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
    - Achieved a model accuracy of 79.16%, with precision of 79.57% and recall of 81.29%, resulting in an F1 Score of 80.42%.
    - Deployed the trained model effectively to provide real-time predictions, enhancing decision-making capabilities for cricket enthusiasts and team management.
