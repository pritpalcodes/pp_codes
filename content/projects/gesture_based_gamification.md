### `Computer Vision`
- #### [Gesture Based Gamification](https://github.com/pritpalcodes/Hand_Detection_Module)
    
    - Implemented a hand detection algorithm to identify hand movements through the webcam.
    - Utilized finger position tracking to recognize specific gestures corresponding to game controls.
    - Interfaced with the game via simulated keyboard inputs, enabling seamless control based on detected gestures.
    - Provided a dynamic and immersive gaming experience, allowing players to interact with the game using intuitive hand gestures.


<!-- - [Snakes.py]().
    
    This classic "Snake & Apple" game, built using the 'pygame' module. It offers a great learning experience for Python beginners while incorporating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. -->


### `Operating Systems`
- #### [Multy Threaded Proxy Server](https://github.com/pritpalcodes/MultiThreadedProxyServer). 
    
    This project is implemented using C and Parsing of HTTP referred from the Proxy Server. 
    - Used Semaphore instead of Condition Variables and pthread_join() and pthread_exit() function.
    - pthread_join() requires us to pass the thread id of the the thread to wait for.
    - Semaphore’s sem_wait() and sem_post() doesn’t need any parameter. So it is a better option.
    
### `Data Structures`
- #### [Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualiser](https://github.com/pritpalcodes/Dijkstra-s_Visualiser). 
    
    Implemented Dijkstra's algorithm visualization tool using Python with technologies such as Sigma JS for graph drawing.
    - Developed intuitive user interface for easy understanding and interaction with the algorithm's execution.
    - Achieved robust model training and deployment, ensuring efficient performance and seamless user experience.



<!-- 
- #### [Sorting Algorithms Visualiser](https://github.com/pritpalcodes/Sorting-Algorithms-Visualiser).

    Implemented Sorting Algorithms visualization tool using Python with technologies such as Sigma JS for graph drawing.
    - Developed intuitive user interface for easy understanding and interaction with the algorithm's execution.
    - Achieved robust model training and deployment, ensuring efficient performance and seamless user experience.

In this example

`acha basically this is a code snippet`

should be wrapped as **code**.
