- #### [CAPEC Web Attack Classifier](https://github.com/pritpalcodes/webAttack_Classifier_ML-Model).
    
    Successfully deployed the trained model into a production environment, enhancing cybersecurity measures with real-time threat detection capabilities.
    - Implemented 5 distinct multilabel machine learning algorithms for the identification and classification of web attacks.
    - Achieved a classification accuracy of 92% on the test dataset, showcasing the effectiveness of the ensemble approach.
    - Utilized Binary Relevance, Random Forest, Label Powerset, Multi-Output Classifier, and LightGBM algorithms to handle the intricate nature of web attack patterns.
    - Conducted extensive experimentation and evaluation, resulting in a 15% improvement in precision and recall compared to baseline models.
