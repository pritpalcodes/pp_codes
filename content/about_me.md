> ### why you might want to ~~go on a date with me~~ give me a job!

My name is **Pritpal (प्रित्पाल/ਪ੍ਰਿਤਪਾਲ) Singh**, however I am famous among my friends as **Preeto**. You can use the pronouns: _he/him/his_ when you talk about me in English. 


I am currently seeking opportunities in the field of AI and Machine Learning.

<!-- intel AI for youth got me started with coding, particularly ML, what I like about it the capability to have a real world impact
Then joined JIIT, still confused what to do, 
Interned at CoE in AI44Education, under Ashish Mishra, and had a learning curve

In 2020, when the world was shut, I got lucky and was selected to attend an apprenticeship program by Intel, AI for Youth. This program got me started with coding, particularly ML. 


I got enrolled in B.Tech in IT from JIIT where I became popular for doing  a task just a night before the submission better than that could have been done in  3 months, once it was assigned.


In Second Semester I interned under [Dr. Amit Mishra](https://www.jiit.ac.in/dr-amit-mishra). During my internship at [Center of Excellence under AI4Education](https://www.jiit.ac.in/centres-excellence), I dove headfirst into the world of Natural Language Processing and developed a model to classify the type of learner based on their writing style.

As an IEEE member, I got a chance to work with the leaders of tommorow and helped me add tools(technologies) in my arsenal. This time I also polished my online persona on stage. These experiences broadened my horizons, keeping me ahead of the curve in a rapidly evolving tech landscape. -->


During my 3rd and 4th Semester of my college, I ventured into the entrepreneurial domain, founding a startup focused on digital marketing: [EpicFly](https://epicfly.in/) Along the way, learnt about making your mark in the digital realm and how to turn your passion into a business.


Currently, I'm knee-deep in the fascinating world of [BCI](linktothephoto) and EEG signals, exploring the mind-bending possibilities at the intersection of neuroscience and tech.

I am fluent in English, Hindi, Punjabi, C++, Python, Java Script, SQL, C, Node.js, MongoDB and BrainF**k(https://gist.github.com/roachhd/dce54bec8ba55fb17d3a). And I have a decent level of proficiency in French, Poetry, React, Flask, Tensorflow, Pytorch, and Langchain. I swim, bike, run, and draw in my free time.
