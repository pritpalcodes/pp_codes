### why you might want to ~~go on a date with me~~ give me a job!

My name is **Pritpal (‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§™‡§æ‡§≤/‡®™‡©ç‡®∞‡®ø‡®§‡®™‡®æ‡®≤) Singh**, however I am famous among my friends as **Preeto**. You can use the pronouns: _he/him/his_ when you talk about me in English. 


I am currently seeking opportunities in the field of AI and Machine Learning.

<!-- That picture up there really is a picture of me, but from 2012. A more recent photo of me is on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oye-pritpal/). -->

<!-- intel AI for youth got me started with coding, particularly ML, what I like about it the capability to have a real world impact
Then joined JIIT, still confused what to do, 
Interned at CoE in AI44Education, under Ashish Mishra, and had a learning curve

In 2020, when the world was shut, I got lucky and was selected to attend an apprenticeship program by Intel, AI for Youth. This program got me started with coding, particularly ML. 


I got enrolled in B.Tech in IT from JIIT where I became popular for doing  a task just a night before the submission better than that could have been done in  3 months, once it was assigned.


In Second Semester I interned under [Dr. Amit Mishra](link). During my internship at [Center of Excellence under AI4Education](link), I dove headfirst into the world of Natural Language Processing and developed a model to classify the type of learner based on their writing style.

<!-- 
As an IEEE member, I got a chance to work with the leaders of tommorow and helped me add tools(technologies) in my arsenal. This time I also polished my online persona on stage. These experiences broadened my horizons, keeping me ahead of the curve in a rapidly evolving tech landscape. -->


During my 3rd and 4th Semester of my college, I ventured into the entrepreneurial domain, founding a startup focused on digital marketing: [EpicFly](https://epicfly.in/) Along the way, learnt about making your mark in the digital realm and how to turn your passion into a business.


Currently, I'm knee-deep in the fascinating world of [BCI](linktothephoto) and EEG signals, exploring the mind-bending possibilities at the intersection of neuroscience and tech. This mind-boggling tinkering fuels my hunger for innovation, ensuring I stay on the cutting edge of engineering prowess. 


I am fluent in English, Hindi, Punjabi, C++, Python, Java Script, SQL, C, Node.js, MongoDB and BrainF**k. And I have a decent level of proficiency in French, Poetry, React, Flask, Tensorflow, Pytorch, and Langchain. I swim, bike, run, and lift weights in my free time. 


Gift me a [Harry Potter Book Set](https://www.amazon.in/Harry-Potter-Boxed-Original-Complete/dp/B0CXF626ZS/ref=sr_1_4?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.HTx1z2VgEUsfhkaiPOj8aDtgF5X3_DM9IjEfAkEjgk7p3XipYlYqOg3SRv4547bGOvOv9ucFcPjlIq8OzZPpVZqq_9toNsgYRfLYeQPa6Xofpg-2xHYYB9J7EXUmqaTk9mbQQF0s7qfDWJiRt4xYeT7Ye6YrWAKoIHTx4NAT0TqXlYgY7Fv7guK9LHQqhglaqByFTuSde8HR3trXujwqiSUAXIK7vaTL-fG-N9-FUhc.AwvF1-I5QPCscDxl4lQVkGzNNo_J9LMkE4iLSJ4PtO8&dib_tag=se&keywords=harry+potter&qid=1713264159&sr=8-4) and I will be the happiest! ü§ó
